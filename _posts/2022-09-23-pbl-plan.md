# Team GrapeSnails PBL Idea
> Our website is going to be a math website which focuses on statistics and calculus. We hope to incorporate math webistes that we use regularly in class into our site for efficiency during lessons. Our sponsor is Mr. Deputron, the statistics teacher. He had some intersting ideas for features when we begin building our wesbtie.

## Our Sponsor's Ideas
- miscellaneous math features (for example a standard deviation calculator)
- incorporate [Random.org](https://www.random.org/)
- incorporate [Stapplet.com](https://www.stapplet.com/)

## Team Ideas / Brainwrite
- a page for past projects (Response Bias Project)
- Calculus Pages (limit calc, derivative calc)
- make the [Stapplet](https://www.stapplet.com/) page more user friendly
- make the Random.org page more user friendly
- discussion board for questions
- Desmos API

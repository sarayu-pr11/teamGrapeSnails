            "content": "Importance of Unit 03 . The Collegeboard website states that this unit makes up 15%-17.5% of the AP test | Almost all the FRQs and multiple choice will contain some kind of if-else statements as it allows for more complex code | Switch case allows for if-else statements to be written more effeciently | Booleans are required for many assignment and comparative logic functions | Boolean allows a programmer to implement choice into their code | . IF Statements . An If statement is a conditional statement that, when true, runs the code inside the statement. . //condition inside if statment is true so system outprints &quot;Hi&quot; if (true) { System.out.println(&quot;Hi&quot;); } //true and not false so system prints out &quot;Hello&quot; if (true &amp;&amp; !false) { System.out.println(&quot;Hello&quot;); } . Hi Hello . If/Else Statement . The If/Else statement extends the If statement by specifying an action if the If (true/false expression) is false. With the If statement, a program will execute the true code block or do nothing. With the If/Else statement, the program will execute either the true code block or the false code block so something is always executed with an If/Else statement. . int x = 10; //if statement is false so the else statment runs if (x&lt;5) { System.out.println(&quot;Hello&quot;); } else { System.out.println(&quot;Greater than 5&quot;); } . Greater than 5 . If/ElseIf Statement . The If/ElseIf statement allows you to create a chain of If statements. You are able to test more than two conditions unlike the If/Else statment. The If statements are evaluated in order until one of the If expressions is true or the end of the If/ElseIf chain is reached. If the end of the If/ElseIf chain is reached without a true expression, no code blocks are executed. . int x = 9; //false conditions until last else if statement so that one runs if (x&lt;2){ System.out.println(&quot;Less than 2&quot;); } else if (x&lt;4){ System.out.println(&quot;Less than 4&quot;); } else if (x&lt;6){ System.out.println(&quot;Less than 6&quot;); } else if (x&lt;8){ System.out.println(&quot;Less than 8&quot;); } else if (x&lt;10){ System.out.println(&quot;Less than 10&quot;); } . Less than 10 . If/ElseIf/Else Statement . If/ElseIf/Else statements are the same as If/ElseIf statements except they have a trailing Else statement added at the end. This way there is executable code if none of the If or Else If statments are true. . char x = &#39;d&#39;; //none of the if or elseif statments are true so it goes through the chain and runs the else statment if (x==&#39;a&#39;){ System.out.println(&quot;x is a&quot;); } else if (x==&#39;b&#39;){ System.out.println(&quot;x is b&quot;); } else if (x==&#39;c&#39;){ System.out.println(&quot;x is c&quot;); } else { System.out.println(&quot;not a, b, or c&quot;); } . not a, b, or c . If/ElseIf/Else statments can be used to decide different program outputs depending on what the user inputted. For example, they would be helpful in a menu program. . Scanner inputStream = new Scanner(System.in); String userInputStr; int choice; System.out.println(&quot;choose an integer 1-5: &quot;); userInputStr = inputStream.nextLine(); choice = Integer.parseInt(userInputStr); //get user input for choice System.out.println(choice); //false conditions until choice equals 4 and only that else if statement runs if (choice==1){ System.out.println(&quot; nyou chose one&quot;); } else if (choice==2){ System.out.println(&quot; nyou chose two&quot;); } else if (choice==3){ System.out.println(&quot; nyou chose three&quot;); } else if (choice==4){ System.out.println(&quot; nyou chose four&quot;); } else if (choice==5){ System.out.println(&quot; nyou chose five&quot;); } else { System.out.println(&quot;invalid input&quot;); } . choose an integer 1-5: 4 you chose four . Switch Statement . A switch statement is usually more efficient than a set of nested ifs. The switch statement is a control flow statement. It evaluates a user selection and different parts of code can be executed quickly. Below, a switch statement will preform the same function as the chain of nested ifs above. . Scanner inputStream = new Scanner(System.in); String userInputStr; int choice; System.out.println(&quot;choose an integer 1-5: &quot;); userInputStr = inputStream.nextLine(); choice = Integer.parseInt(userInputStr); System.out.println(choice); switch (choice) { //based on what the user inputted for the choice variable, different cases will run case 1: System.out.println(&quot; nyou chose one&quot;); break; case 2: System.out.println(&quot; nyou chose two&quot;); break; case 3: System.out.println(&quot; nyou chose three&quot;); break; //default prevents it from moving on to and running the following cases case 4: System.out.println(&quot; nyou chose four&quot;); break; case 5: System.out.println(&quot; nyou chose five&quot;); break; default: System.out.println(&quot;invalid input&quot;); } . choose an integer 1-5: 4 you chose four . Boolean Expressions . A Boolean expression is a logical statement that is either True or False. Boolean expressions can compare any type of data if both parts of the expression have the same basic data type. A Boolean expression can be a combination of the Boolean constants true or false. . All non zero numbers are true . the most common example: 1 = true; 0 = false | == checks for comparison | not to be confused with = which is assignment | != checks for inequality | . if (3 == 3) { System.out.println(&quot;True&quot;); } if (3 != 4) { System.out.println(&quot;True&quot;); } . True True . &lt;, &gt;, &gt;=, &lt;= | these operands do their normal functions | . if ( 3 &gt; 2) { System.out.println(&quot;true&quot;); } if (4 &lt;= 4) { System.out.println(&quot;true&quot;); } . true true . || relates to the or function | &amp;&amp; related to and function | . if ( true || false) { System.out.println(&quot;true&quot;); } if (true &amp;&amp; true) { System.out.println(&quot;true&quot;); } . true true . You can also use booleans in conjunction with other operators as well . var a = 4; if ((a%2) == 0) { System.out.println(&quot;true&quot;); } . true . . Logic Gates . Logic gates are used to carry out logical operations on single or multiple binary inputs and give one binary output. In simple terms, logic gates are the electronic circuits in a digital system. . . Buffer/YES : output is the same as the input | NOT : output is the opposite of the input | AND : returns true if both inputs are true | NAND : returns false if both inputs are true | OR : returns true if at least one of the inputs are true, returns false if both inputs are false | NOR : returns false if at least one of the inputs are true, returns true if both inputs are false | XOR : returns true if the two inputs are different | XNOR : returns true if two inputs are the same | . . These tables demonstrate the input and output combinations of different logic gates . Tips to help remember the symbols: each main shape is unique to a logic gate (ex: triangle = buffer/YES) | a small circle represents the addition of &quot;NOT&quot; to the logic gate | a small curved line represents the addition of &quot;exclusive&quot; or &quot;X&quot; to the logic gate | . | . De Morgan&#39;s Law . DeMorgan&#39;s laws tell us how to transform logical expressions (with multiple AND and/or OR statements) using the NOT operator. . (not(A and B)) is equal to (not A or not B) | (not(A or B)) is equal to (not A and not B) | (not(A and B)) is not equal to (not A and not B) | . . Syntax . union symbol (∪) : OR | intersection of sets symbol (∩) : AND | apostrophe (&#39;) : NOT | . boolean a = true; boolean b = false; //Not (A and B) boolean result1 = !(a &amp;&amp; b); //Not A or Not B boolean result2 = ((!a) || (!b)); if (result1 == result2){ System.out.println(&quot;result 1 and 2 are the same&quot;); } else{ //result 1 and 2 will always be equal, the code should never reach here System.out.println(&quot;Error&quot;); } //Not (A or B) boolean result3 = !(a || b); //Not A and Not B boolean result4 = ((!a) &amp;&amp; (!b)); if (result3 == result4){ System.out.println(&quot;result 3 and 4 are the same&quot;); } else{ //result 3 and 4 will always be equal, the code should never reach here System.out.println(&quot;Error&quot;); } . result 1 and 2 are the same result 3 and 4 are the same . Truth Tables . A truth table is a breakdown of a logic function by listing all possible values the function can attain. Such a table typically contains several rows and columns, with the top row representing the logical variables and combinations, in increasing complexity leading up to the final function. .
